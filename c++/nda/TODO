- SSO + custsom alloc

  - reread handle_sso impl. 
  - should we keep it AND handle_stack or just one ? (with CToption)
  - pass all tests with this as default ?
  - clean bench. repass it on linux

  - custom alloc :
    - keep as is experimental
 
  - stack + non-pod

- C++17 mode
  - compile and recheck

- Sanitizer. Including MSAN. 
  Can I have this in the CI ?? 
  CI : nda : all test, clang, gcc, c++17, c++20, ASAN + UBSAN, MSAN -> log to me and or find the docker.


- layout : 

  - reread slice.
  - more test for any order ?
  - Can I put a Fortran order in all tests ?? :   NO HDF5
    Then all cycle + 1 or reverse cycle ?
  - Or a default permutation ?? How many test of rank > 2 ?

  - copy, assign
  - check contiguouity at CT.

  - rename  

- arithm : reread for doc.

- literals : nda::literals::_ and ___ 
  ellipsis_t -> ellipsis_t

- finir MPI refactor

- file array.hpp 
  include core + alias  

- linking : just rtable ??

- rebind ?
- matmul lazy ?
- zeros : revue the initi_zero and maybe rebname this detail
